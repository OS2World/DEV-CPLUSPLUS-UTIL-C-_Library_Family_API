CREDIT

    Credit where credit is due. This document was inspired by the FSF General
    Public License ("'c' for common noun", people !). However, it is not that
    licence, and items covered by this licence are not covered by the FSF
    licence.

APOLOGIA

    I have tried to write this document in Real English, rather than any legal
    argot (dictionary definition: "The language of thieves"). So when I say
    "spade", please read "groundsoil restructuring implement".

DEFINITIONS

    The "Software" is the release of the Family API library for Borland C++
    and OS/2, the Shareware version of which I have uploaded to Mission
    Impossible BBS and Abacus Vortex BBS in the United Kingdom. "I" refers
    to the copyright holder and "You" the licensee.

THIS LICENCE

    I retain copyright over this licence. You may not alter it. However, I
    grant you permission to use it in relation to any of your own works not in
    any way already covered by it.

    I retain copyright over the Software. However, I grant you this licence to
    retain, copy, use, and redistribute it, subject to some conditions. If you
    violate these conditions, you implicitly surrender all rights to the
    Software.

    If you exercise any or the rights to copy, use, or redistribute the
    Software granted to you by this Licence, you implicitly indicate your
    acceptance of its terms.

    If you wish to redistribute the Software or a derivative under any other
    terms and conditions, you must obtain written permision from me.

    This Licence has a version number and date. Any Software covered by a
    version of this Licence either states the version number or numbers that
    are applicable, or should be considered to be covered by the latest
    version of this Licence dated before the date of the Software.

    Programs licenced under this licence fall into three categories, covered
    by different versions of the licence : Shareware & Registered Software,
    Non-Chargeable Software, and Source Licenced Software.

GUARANTEE or WARRANTY

    There is no guarantee or warranty.

    If you redistribute the Software, your relation to third parties is the
    same as mine to you in this respect, unless you specifically issue a
    warranty (in which case, do not involve me please), for which you may
    charge a fee.

    (Non-chargeable Software)

    Since you have not paid any money for this version of the Software, there
    is no guarantee or warranty, nor any promise that the Software is of any
    merchantable quality, that it does what it is claimed that it does, not
    even that it does anything at all.

    The Software is supplied "as-is", and any risks you take by having or
    using it are entirely your own. If anything happens to you, your machine,
    your data, or your cat (for all I know) as a result of possession or use
    of the Software, you have no legal redress, except any given to you by
    statute of course.

COPYING, USE, MODIFICATION and REDISTRIBUTION

    (Non-chargeable Software)

    You may make as many copies as you like of the Software for archival and
    security purposes, or redistribution.

    You may only redistribute the original shareware form of the Software
    without modifications, and may not transfer anything other than the whole
    Software complete with documentation and licence.

    You may not charge for redistribution other than for time and materials.

    You may not modify, discompile, or reverse engineer the Software.
