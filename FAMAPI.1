    because saving paper saves the environment.

    This file contains documentation for the Family API portion of the C++
    library written for Borland C++ version 3.x by Jonathan de Boyne Pollard.
    The library has been tested in programs compiled for real and protected
    mode under OS/2 2.0 and DR-DOS 6.0.

    Although I have taken great pains to ensure that the library is
    problem-free (or at least, any known problems are thoroughly documented),
    if you do find a problem with it, please contact me in writing at the
    address given and I will attempt to cure it. Please provide example source
    code and makefiles where possible.

    Purpose
    ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

    You will need this Family API library to develop 16-bit dual mode
    OS/2 programs using Borland C++ 3.x for DOS.

    Although it is not needed in protected mode, this provides support for
    v8086 and real mode DOS equivalents for all OS/2 calls made by the
    Cx.LIB libraries.

    This library can also be used as a separate product for those who wish
    to use all of the functionality of OS/2's high-level-language API
    instead of assembly language calls for PC-DOS.

    Full source is provided for your reference only. Note that COPYING.DOC
    restricts you to only distributing the original library in the original
    form that you obtained it. The MANIFEST document details what the
    library should contain.

    Family API calls
    ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

    Full documentation of the Family API calls can be found in any good OS/2
    1.x 16-bit reference. Most 16-bit OS/2 calls map directly from the
    PC-DOS API, although the parameters and functions of some were tidied up
    some.

    The PRCP.INF file is also available as shareware (not from me, though!)
    for those who wish to have the 16-bit API in INF format. I use it myself
    just to cross-check this library.

    It is interesting to note that the December 1992 beta release of OS/2
    2.1 contained versions of Dos16SubSet/Dos16SubAlloc/Dos16SubFree that
    would cause segmentation faults under certain conditions.

    The author linked the versions of those calls supplied here instead of
    the DOSCALLS1.DLL versions, and the author's worked in protected mode.
    At the time of writing it is unknown whether the 2.1 GA code has been
    fixed (GA release is tomorrow would you believe ?).

    Source
    ÄÄÄÄÄÄ

    In order to recompile, you will need the <dos.h>, <os2.h>, and
    <limits.h> headers from the shareware Borland C++ 3.x cross-development
    kit for OS/2. This has not been released at the time of writing, so the
    INCLUDE.ZIP file contains the current versions of the headers.

>PA

    Mou Calls
    ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

    Note that the Mou calls have not been implemented. It is hoped that they
    will be in a future version of this library.

    Vio Calls
    ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

    The Vio routines will handle all text modes, and (to some extent)
    graphics modes as well. However, background colours will not work in
    graphics modes, and you may discover some oddities.

    It is not the intention of this library to provide a graphics library
    for DOS programs. If you wish to pursue graphics programs, I suggest
    that you move directly to Presentation Manager.

    The Vio mode changing routines will not handle dual monitors, although
    this is of some inconvenience to the author, who is working on it for a
    future release.

    Kbd Calls
    ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

    The Kbd calls do not support some of the more esoteric features of the
    Kbd interface, such as raw mode and reporting shift states. It is
    suggested that anyone wishing to use such functionality switch to
    Presentation Manager, which provides a much better keyboard interface.

    The Kbd subsystem implemented here only accomodates enough to implement
    <conio.h> functionality in the Borland C++ 16-bit cross-development
    library.

    Dos Calls
    ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

    The more obscure calls Dos, such as DosDevIoctl, have not been
    implemented either, for the same reason, and also because the 16-bit
    interface is not out of date for OS/2.

    If you wish to tinker with the hardware directly, it is suggested that
    you use the full 32-bit interface, which more fully supports CD-ROM and
    Network file systems, as well as HPFS.

    Forthcoming developments
    ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

    As part of an effort to standardise cross-platform development on OS/2,
    a future version of this library is planned that will link as a 16-bit
    DLL under Microsoft Windows 3.x.

    It is the author's belief that the library will work as it stands under
    Windows 3.x, although the Dos3Call can be changed to use the
    undocumented KERNEL call of the same name instead of issuing an INT 21h
    instruction.

    This allows the Borland C++ 16-bit conversion kit to link smaller
    Windows 3.x programs with no change fo source code.

    We look forward to a shareware MIRRORS system ...

    Other products from Jonathan de Boyne Pollard
    ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

    Naturally, the Borland C++ for DOS 16-bit devlopment kit for OS/2 is
    also available as BC3-OS2.ZIP.

    Also available as shareware are twin sets of command-line utilities for
    DOS and OS/2 sessions (DOSCLUnn.ZIP and OS2CLUnn.ZIP), developed with
    this library, including :

    ş FF - File Finder ş extended ATTRIB command ş
    ş extended XDIR and XDEL commands ş WHICH file search utility ş
    ş TOUCH file date/time utility ş Intelligent file DUMP ş
    ş MEM memory (XMS/DPMI) display for DOS ş
    ş And (as they say) many, many, more ...

    These will be available from all good BBSes. If they are not available
    to you locally they are also available for downloading from Mission
    Impossible BBS in the United Kingdom, on +44 602
    655394/654329/654680/653247.
